## Classification
Design Patterns are classified 3 categories based on what kind of problem they solve. Below are the categories
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

### Creational
Creational patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way.

- [Singleton Pattern](singleton/README.md)

### Structural
Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality

- [Decorator Pattern](decorator/README.md)
- [Facade Pattern](facade/README.md)
- [Proxy Pattern](proxy/README.md)

### Behavioral
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
